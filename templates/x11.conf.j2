# X11 SLURM spank plugin configuration file
#
# this plugin can be used to add X11 support in slurm jobs using ssh X11
# tunneling capabilities
#
# The following configuration parameters are available (the character | 
# replaces the space in compound options) :
#
# ssh_cmd	: can be used to modify the ssh binary to use.
# 		  default corresponds to ssh_cmd=ssh
# ssh_args	: can be used to modify the ssh arguments to use.
# 		  default corresponds to ssh_cmd=
# helpertask_cmd: can be used to add a trailing argument to the helper task 
# 		  responsible for setting up the ssh tunnel
# 		  default corresponds to helpertask_cmd=
#		  an interesting value can be helpertask_cmd=2>/tmp/log to
#		  capture the stderr of the helper task
#
# Users can ask for X11 support for both interactive (srun) and batch (sbatch)
# jobs using parameter --x11=[batch|first|last|all] or the SLURM_SPANK_X11 
# environment variable set to the required value.
#
# In interactive mode (srun), values can be first to establish a tunnel with
# the first allocated node, last for the last one and all for all nodes.
#
# In batch mode (sbatch), only "batch" mode can be used but batch script can
# be used first|last|all values with srun. In batch mode, the first allocated 
# node will contact the submission node using ssh to establish the tunnel
# from the submission node to itself. As a result, the user must kept its 
# initial connection to the submission host as long as it wants to be able to 
# forward its X11 display to batch execution node.
